Binary Search Tree Implementation in JavaScript

This repository contains an implementation of a binary search tree (BST) in JavaScript. The binary search tree is a data structure that allows for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Features

  Node: The Node function creates a new node with a given value and optional parent reference.
  
  Tree: The Tree function creates a binary search tree with various methods for building, inserting, deleting, searching, and traversing nodes.
  
  buildTree: Builds a binary search tree from an array of values.
  
  insert: Inserts a new value into the binary search tree.
  
  deleteItem: Deletes a node with a specified value from the binary search tree.
  
  find: Searches for a node with a specified value in the binary search tree.
  
  levelOrder: Performs a level-order traversal of the binary search tree.
  
  inOrder: Performs an in-order traversal of the binary search tree.
  
  preOrder: Performs a pre-order traversal of the binary search tree.
  
  postOrder: Performs a post-order traversal of the binary search tree.
  
  height: Calculates the height of a given node in the binary search tree.
  
  depth: Calculates the depth of a given node in the binary search tree.
  
  isBalanced: Checks whether the binary search tree is balanced.
  
  rebalance: Rebalances the binary search tree if it is unbalanced.

Usage

To use the binary search tree implementation:

1. Import the Node and Tree functions from the provided JavaScript file (binarytree.js).

2. Create a new instance of the Tree object.

3. Use the available methods to build, insert, delete, search, and traverse nodes in the binary search tree.
